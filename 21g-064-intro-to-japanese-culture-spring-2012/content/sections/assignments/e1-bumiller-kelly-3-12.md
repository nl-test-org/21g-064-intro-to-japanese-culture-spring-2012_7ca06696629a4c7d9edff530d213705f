In his article "Finding a Place in Metropolitan Japan," William Kelly criticizes the recurring "consensus versus conflict" debate about Japanese society and culture. In his words, "This debate has pitted, for example, those who characterize Japanese commitment to the group and the natural harmony of a homogeneous society against those who insist on individual difference, opposition to the group, and structural inequalities" (pp. 191–2). Kelly argues instead for an alternative understanding of the patterns in Japanese society by focusing on ideologies, institutions and everyday life.

Using examples from Elizabeth Bumiller's book _Secrets of Mariko_, analyze the ways that such "ideologies, institutions, and everyday concerns" have shaped Mariko's life.

In particular, please discuss by taking a stand either for or against one (1) of the following assertions:

1.  Japanese society discriminates against women.
2.  Women have it better than men in Japanese society.
3.  Mariko is a sign of a changing Japan.

If you prefer to choose a different theme to focus on, that is OK, but please discuss it with me first.
